# Creating an IAM User for Programmatic Access (s3-lambda-user)

This guide outlines the steps to create a new AWS IAM user with programmatic access. The user will be configured with permissions for Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda, and we will generate and download the necessary access key credentials.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account with administrative permissions to create IAM users and policies.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Navigate to IAM & Start User Creation

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2.  Navigate to the **IAM** service.
3.  In the left-hand navigation pane, click on **Users**.
4.  Click the **Create user** button.

### 2. Specify User Details

1.  In the **User name** field, enter `s3-lambda-user`.
2.  Ensure the checkbox for **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console** is **left unchecked**. This user is for services, not for a person to log in.
3.  Click **Next**.

### 3. Set Permissions

1.  On the "Set permissions" page, select the option to **Attach policies directly**.
2.  A search box and a list of policies will appear. In the search box, type `AmazonS3FullAccess`.
3.  Check the box next to the **AmazonS3FullAccess** policy in the list.
4.  Clear the search box and now search for `AWSLambda_FullAccess`.
5.  Check the box next to the **AWSLambda_FullAccess** policy.
6.  Click **Next**.

### 4. Review and Create User

1.  You will see a summary of the user you are about to create.
2.  Confirm that the user name is `s3-lambda-user` and that the two correct policies are attached.
3.  Click **Create user**.

### 5. Generate the Access Key

After the user is created, you are taken back to the user list. You must now generate the credentials.

1.  From the user list, click on the user name **`s3-lambda-user`**.
2.  On the user's summary page, click the **Security credentials** tab.
3.  Scroll down to the **Access keys** section and click **Create access key**.

### 6. Configure Access Key Use Case

1.  On the "Access key best practices & alternatives" page, select the use case. For this guide, we chose **Local code**.
2.  Click **Next**.
3.  Acknowledge the recommendation by checking the box: **"I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key."**
4.  Click **Next**.
5.  On the "Set description tag" screen (optional), click **Create access key**.

### 7. Download the Credentials CSV File

1.  You will now be on the final screen, "Retrieve access keys".
2.  Click the **Download .csv file** button. This file contains the **Access key** and the **Secret access key**.

## ⚠️ Important Security Notice

* The **Secret access key** is only visible on this final screen. If you do not save it or download the `.csv` file, you will have to create a new access key.
* Treat the downloaded `.csv` file like a password. Store it in a secure location and do not commit it to a public code repository (like GitHub).
* **Best Practice:** For applications running on AWS services like Lambda or EC2, the most secure method is to use an **IAM Role** instead of an IAM user with long-term access keys. An IAM Role provides temporary, automatically rotated credentials.
